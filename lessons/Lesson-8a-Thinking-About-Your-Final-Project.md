In the following series of lessons, you will create a complete (if very basic) Rails application, with styling and testing.

For your final project, you also need to create a complete Rails application.  So, consider these alternatives:

1. You follow the lessons as described, and do your final project as a separate effort; or
2. You implement all the features of assignments 8, 9, 10, and 11, but you do that using your own data models, so that you end up with the basis for your final project.

The advantage of option 1 is that you can follow the instructions in the lessons exactly.  But then you'll have to start over when you are building your final project. The advantage of option 2 is that you'll be much farther along with your final project.

Suppose you choose option 2. You still have to do all the things described in lessons 8 through 11 to complete those assignments, and you still need to turn that homework in when it is due (but using your own data model).  The lessons, as they are written, create customers and orders, where a customer has many orders.  You'd want to choose something else more interesting: books, rental properties, parks, volunteer opportunities, games, pets, art, music, or whatever interests you. You still need to meet all the requirements of the final project rubric [here.](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/R7-additional/wiki/Ruby-on-Rails-Final-Project-Rubric) Your project should have something more: You might implement authentication with Devise, or a front end in React with a Rails API, or more complicated data models, or callouts to third party APIs, or use of Active Storage -- whatever makes sense for you.

So, you could do either 1 or 2, whichever you prefer.  If you stay with the lessons as written, it's still a good idea to get started thinking about your final project, and about how you can use the ideas in these lessons to get that project done.
